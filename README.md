Assume you are working on a cricket analytics platform that processes and stores vast amounts 
of data for multiple cricket tournaments. You are tasked with creating a program to manage the 
bowling details of a cricket team during a 5-over match. Each bowler's performance, ball-byball, needs to be recorded. Furthermore, you should be able to print a summary of each bowler's 
performance at any point. Explain how you would use jagged arrays to efficiently store the 
bowling details and bowler performance summary. See below two tables for details.
